The goal of this project is to create a flexible, MCMC-based fitting
utility to compare Monte Carlo simulations and data from a scientific
experiment.  It is a continuation of my doctoral thesis project.

It uses ConfigFile.h from someone on the internet (look this up), but
also has a "meta-config" option, that can now be read directly by the
main program.
