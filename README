The goal of this project is to create a flexible, MCMC-based fitting
utility to compare Monte Carlo simulations and data from a scientific
experiment.  It is a continuation of my doctoral thesis project.

It uses the open source ConfigFile program by Richard J. Wagner as a
config file reader, but also has a "meta-config" option, that can now
be read directly by the main program.
